    <p>Hi guys!</p>
    <p>How are you?<p>
    <p>Mi name is Daniel (I'm the one who is on the left side of the picture). I'm a 26 years-old student that is starting his studys of programming and web development (wish me luck!)</p>
    <p> I live in Caracas, Venezuela. Which is a very beautiful country. I love playing chess, basketball and video games, also I like to meet new people, enjoy good converdations, make excersise at the gym, meditate, pray and read</p>
    <p> My goal for this year is to learn how to be a developer and study english (I have plans to stude psychology as well). All of this because I want to improve my employability and use wisely the time that God gave me on this earth. I hope to do a good job in this course.</p>
